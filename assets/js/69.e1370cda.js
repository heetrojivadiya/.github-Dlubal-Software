Those should enable to create async loop and send the requests to server as quickly as possible. All in one connection, using one thread, just awaiting the callbacks. Which is exactly the thing that slows the execution. Don't get us wrong, we tried to implement it, but neither asyncio or async-suds (SUDS based on asyncio) wants to work here. To add to the trouble, we think that it is not much usefull feature. Large number of the executions are order dependent anyway. RFEM can't create line if there is one point missing. So if the order is the same but client doesn't have to wait for individual responces, it could be utilized.
